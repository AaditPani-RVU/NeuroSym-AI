Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-12 — "Near-miss reporting"

### Added

- **Near-miss reporting** — `SemanticInjectionRule` now accepts a `near_miss_threshold`
  parameter (default `0.0`, disabled). When set, inputs that score between
  `near_miss_threshold` and `threshold` produce `NearMiss` entries in `GuardResult.near_misses`
  instead of violations. Useful for monitoring borderline traffic, threshold tuning, and
  flagging inputs for human review without blocking them.
- **`NearMiss` dataclass** and **`NearMissRule` protocol** exported from `neurosym` top level
  and `neurosym.rules`. Rules implementing `NearMissRule` are automatically called by
  `Guard.apply()` and `Guard.aapply()` when no violations were raised.
- `GuardResult.near_misses` field (list of dicts) included in `to_dict()` output.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-12 — "BanTopicsRule, SemanticInjectionRule late_resolve hardening"

### Added

- **`BanTopicsRule`** (`rules/harm.py`) — topic-based harm detection that fires on dangerous
  subject matter regardless of phrasing. Closes the structural blind spot in tone/injection-based
  classifiers (100% bypass rate on harmful_content seeds found by Lethe 2026-05-10): clinically-
  or academically-worded synthesis requests score near 0.0 on Toxicity + PromptInjection scanners
  but are caught by topic-pattern matching. Includes four built-in presets:
  - `cbrn_weapons` — CBRN synthesis: explosives (TATP, RDX, PETN), nerve agents (sarin, VX,
    novichok), biological toxins (ricin, botulinum), IED/pipe bomb construction instructions.
  - `drug_synthesis` — illicit drug production: fentanyl, methamphetamine, MDMA, clandestine labs.
  - `self_harm_methods` — suicide and self-harm method requests.
  - `malware_exploit` — working exploit code for CVEs, ransomware/rootkit/RAT creation.
  - Patterns are bidirectional (substance-then-verb and verb-then-substance) with `re.DOTALL`
    so they fire across multi-line prompts regardless of word order.
  - `extra_patterns` parameter for custom additions; `available_presets()` for introspection.

- **`SemanticInjectionRule` tail-segment check** — new `tail_fraction` parameter (default 0.25)
  evaluates the last 25% of the input in isolation alongside the full-text check. Addresses the
  Lethe `late_resolve` bypass: a ~60–80-token innocent preamble context-shifts the full-text
  embedding below threshold even when an injection payload is present at the end. The tail check
  catches the payload independently of its preamble. Violation meta includes `check_mode`
  (`"full"` or `"tail"`), `tail_fraction`, and `tail_word_count` for audit traces. Disabled with
  `tail_fraction=0.0` for backwards-compatible behaviour.

### Added (tests)

- `tests/test_ban_topics.py` — 40 tests: CBRN synthesis true-positives (bidirectional patterns,
  Lethe jb-004 pharma-preamble pipe bomb), drug synthesis, self-harm method requests, working
  exploit true-positives; 18 safe/educational true-negatives including historical mentions,
  addiction/symptom queries, and "explain how X works" queries; preset isolation, extra_patterns,
  `available_presets`, violation field correctness, user_message sanitization, top-level export.
- `tests/test_semantic_injection.py` — 8 new tail-check tests in
  `TestSemanticInjectionRuleTailCheck`: tail fires when full-text passes, full-text early-exit
  (encode called once), `check_mode` field on both violation paths, `tail_fraction=0.0` disables
  tail check, short-text tail skipped, both-below-threshold → None.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-10 — "Semantic fallback, lean install, forecaster hardening"

### Added

- **`SemanticInjectionRule`** (`rules/semantic.py`) — embedding-based fallback detector that
  catches paraphrase attacks missed by the regex layer. Uses `sentence-transformers`
  (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2` by default) with cosine similarity against curated per-category attack
  centroids. Block rate target: 95%+ combined with `PromptInjectionRule`. Composable with
  existing rules; model and centroids are pinned per version for reproducible audit traces.
- **`neurosym/rules/centroids/injection-centroids-v1.json`** — 9 attack categories × ~8
  paraphrase centroid texts each; designed to catch paraphrases that bypass all regex presets.
- **`[embeddings]` extra** (`pip install 'neurosym-ai[embeddings]'`) — gates
  `sentence-transformers>=3.0` and `numpy>=1.24` as optional dependencies.
- **`[cli]` extra** — `typer>=0.12` and `rich>=13.7` moved out of core.
- **`[llm]` extra** — `httpx>=0.27` and `tenacity>=9.0` moved out of core.
- **`[forecaster]` extra** — `pydantic>=2.0` and `PyYAML>=6.0` moved out of core.
- **`[all]` extra** — convenience meta-extra that installs every optional feature.
- **`impact_exceptions.py`** — `ImpactForecastUnavailable` split into its own zero-dep module
  so `import neurosym` never fails when `[forecaster]` is not installed.

### Fixed

- **`ImpactAgent.hypothesize()` silent `[]` on failure** — all failure paths (`result.ok=False`,
  unparseable output, schema mismatch) now raise `ImpactForecastUnavailable` with a descriptive
  `.reason`. Returning `[]` on failure was indistinguishable from "no impact found".
- **`ImpactForecastUnavailable` not exported from forecaster package** — now re-exported from
  `neurosym.agents.impact_forecaster` in addition to the top-level `neurosym` namespace.

### Changed

- **Core install footprint reduced** — `dependencies` in `pyproject.toml` trimmed from 7 packages
  to 1 (`jsonschema`). Guard + rules + benchmark now work with a minimal install.
- **`dev` extra** now depends on `neurosym-ai[all]` so the full test suite always runs against
  every optional feature.

### Added (tests)

- `tests/test_semantic_injection.py` — 20 structural/mock tests + 10 integration tests
  (skipped when `sentence-transformers` not installed): threshold behaviour, category filtering,
  meta field correctness, `ImportError` path, `evaluate()` normalisation contract.
- `tests/test_impact_agent.py` — 15 tests for `ImpactAgent.hypothesize()`: happy path (single,
  multiple, empty list, pre-parsed Python list, markdown-fenced JSON), failure paths (guard
  failure, unparseable output, schema mismatch, wrong type), regression for the silent-`[]` bug,
  export contract from both `neurosym` and `neurosym.agents.impact_forecaster`.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-03 — "Test the v0.3.0 surface"

### Fixed

- **Guard.stream() yield-before-check** (Codex adversarial finding): the chunk that triggers a
  hard-deny streaming rule was previously forwarded to the consumer before the denial was checked.
  Fixed in `engine/guard.py` — the hard-deny check now runs before `yield`, so the violating
  chunk is suppressed entirely.

### Added (tests)

- `tests/test_output_secrets.py` — `SecretLeakageRule`: AWS, GitHub, Google, Slack, Stripe,
  JWT, bearer, private-key headers; negative cases (UUIDs, hex hashes); full `StreamingRule`
  contract (chunk feeding, cross-boundary detection via the 256-char overlap window, `reset()`).
- `tests/test_output_system_prompt.py` — `SystemPromptRegurgitationRule`: verbatim match,
  sliding-window partial match, false-positive guards, custom `min_span` behaviour.
- `tests/test_streaming.py` — `Guard.stream()`: clean-stream, rule partitioning (batch vs.
  streaming), regression test for the yield-before-check bug, `deny_above` path.
- `tests/test_agents_loader.py` — `load_agent_prompt`, `invalidate_cache`, `AgentNotFoundError`,
  `AgentLoadError` on empty file, `lru_cache` identity, all `registry` functions (`list_agents`,
  `agent_exists`, `get_agent`).
- `tests/test_doctor_cli.py` — `python -m neurosym doctor` exit-code, version string, deps
  section, rule-packs section, benchmark output; Typer entrypoint help and no-args behaviour.

### Added
